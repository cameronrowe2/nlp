Natural Language Processing

There are two ways to run this project:
1. to add non trend words to the file to omit them from the trending algorithm
2. to return trends from a sentence

To add non trend words to file run:
node .

Then follow the prompts. You will be prompted to enter a sentence, and then if the word is not in the file you will be prompted to enter "O" if the word is not a trend word.

To return trends from a sentence run:
node trend

Then go to localhost:3000/?sentence=This is your sentence

Add any sentence you want to get trended terms returned from this API call.
